#SimpleSpray

Using Ian Millington's Vector3 Class demonstrating a simple "water" spray in Java. 

Inspired by [PlayfulJs](https://github.com/hunterloftis/playfuljs-demos/tree/gh-pages/particles2) as well. Though not as pretty, I thought my version looked a bit more like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) so I stuck with it.
